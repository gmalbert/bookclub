Composed with the skills of a master, The Goldfinch is a haunted odyssey through present day America and a drama of enthralling force and acuity.

It begins with a boy. Theo Decker, a thirteen-year-old New Yorker, miraculously survives an accident that kills his mother. Abandoned by his father, Theo is taken in by the family of a wealthy friend. Bewildered by his strange new home on Park Avenue, disturbed by schoolmates who don't know how to talk to him, and tormented above all by his unbearable longing for his mother, he clings to one thing that reminds him of her: a small, mysteriously captivating painting that ultimately draws Theo into the underworld of art. 

As an adult, Theo moves silkily between the drawing rooms of the rich and the dusty labyrinth of an antiques store where he works. He is alienated and in love-and at the center of a narrowing, ever more dangerous circle. 

The Goldfinch is a novel of shocking narrative energy and power. It combines unforgettably vivid characters, mesmerizing language, and breathtaking suspense, while plumbing with a philosopher's calm the deepest mysteries of love, identity, and art. It is a beautiful, stay-up-all-night and tell-all-your-friends triumph, an old-fashioned story of loss and obsession, survival and self-invention, and the ruthless machinations of fate.",https://assets.hardcover.app/editions/30399797/9607564183148250.jpg,2025-10-20 20:56:24
1084101,You Like It Darker,Stephen King,2024.0,512.0,4.0625,120.0,"Horror, Fiction, Science fiction, Fantasy, Short stories, Short Story Collection, speculative fiction","From legendary storyteller and master of short fiction Stephen King comes an extraordinary new collection of twelve short stories, many never-before-published, and some of his best EVER.

âYou like it darker? Fine, so do I,â writes Stephen King in the afterword to this magnificent new collection of twelve stories that delve into the darker part of lifeâboth metaphorical and literal. King has, for half a century, been a master of the form, and these stories, about fate, mortality, luck, and the folds in reality where anything can happen, are as rich and riveting as his novels, both weighty in theme and a huge pleasure to read. King writes to feel âthe exhilaration of leaving ordinary day-to-day life behind,â and in You Like It Darker, readers will feel that exhilaration too, again and again.

âTwo Talented Bastidsâ explores the long-hidden secret of how the eponymous gentlemen got their skills. In âDanny Coughlinâs Bad Dream,â a brief and unprecedented psychic flash upends dozens of lives, Dannyâs most catastrophically. In âRattlesnakes,â a sequel to Cujo, a grieving widower travels to Florida for respite and instead receives an unexpected inheritanceâwith major strings attached. In âThe Dreamers,â a taciturn Vietnam vet answers a job ad and learns that there are some corners of the universe best left unexplored. âThe Answer Manâ asks if prescience is good luck or bad and reminds us that a life marked by unbearable tragedy can still be meaningful.

Kingâs ability to surprise, amaze, and bring us both terror and solace remains unsurpassed. Each of these stories holds its own thrills, joys, and mysteries; each feels iconic. You like it darker? You got it.",https://assets.hardcover.app/editions/31108137/3100829816858193.jpg,2025-10-20 21:03:14

The unforgettable memoir by the late Virginia Roberts Giuffre, the woman who dared to take on Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell. In April 2025, Giuffre took her own life. She left behind a memoir written in the years preceding her death and stated unequivocally that she wanted it published. 

Nobody’s Girl is the riveting and powerful story of an ordinary girl who would grow up to confront extraordinary adversity. Here, Giuffre offers an unsparing and definitive account of her time with Epstein and Maxwell, who trafficked her and others to numerous prominent men. 

She also details the molestation she suffered as a child, as well as her daring escape from Epstein and Maxwell’s grasp at nineteen. Giuffre remade her life from scratch and summoned the courage to not only hold her abusers to account but also advocate for other victims. The pages of Nobody’s Girl preserve her voice—and her legacy—forever. 

Nobody’s Girl is an astonishing affirmation of Giuffre’s unshakable will—first, to claw her way out of victimhood, and then to shine light on wrongdoing and fight for a safer, fairer world. Equal parts intimate and fierce, it is a remarkable narrative of fortitude in the face of depravity and despair.",https://assets.hardcover.app/edition/32308063/3eb547a5-a986-41fd-84ac-a8045c6f626a.jpg,2026-03-01 00:55:06
